# Installation
The manual install is pretty tricky but very once you do it right its absurly *****EZ*****
1. Get ur hands on this ***sweet*** & *simple* project (Be aware it can be **big**)
by downloading them all toghether (mlg fiber 1ms) or by pieces (low bandwidth connection)
and if you want get a fresh copy of [boon](https://github.com/camchenry/boon/)

2. extract this project to somewhere you can work with

3. cut | copy and then paste the files from the compressed archive
Contents:
`Your app data folder`

`boon`
 
`	versions etc`

4. paste `boon` in your appdata folder
	4.1 In windows you can find it by presing: `win`+`r` then typing `%appdata%` in the textbox then pressing `Enter` or `Return` then navigate up by one folder and goto `Local`
		4.1.1 Or going to: `C:\Users\`Your user folder`\Appdata\Local`
	4.2 In linux much ***MUCH*** simpler its **EZ** just go to your file manager that pretty much is already in your folder, then press `ctrl`+`H` if you don't see any folder starting with `.` (the hidden folders) then goto `.local` and paste it, that should be enough.
	6.3 In mac well... i dunno and i dont care but this piece of the tutorial is ready for a pull request by somebody who knows that.
	
5. then extract the matching-os boon executable (if windows then `boon.exe`, if mac then `boon.dmg` etc)
